# spring-cache-poc

A POC for working with Spring Cache.

## Getting Started

Easiest way to get started is use VSCode and Dev Containers to quickly get up to speed.

Call against `http://localhost:8080` to test how caching works, using the simulated `Thread.sleep()` to simulate a long processing method. On subsequent calls, you should notice the random number is the same, plus the performance is much faster.
